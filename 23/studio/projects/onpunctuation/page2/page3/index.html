			So now to come to the real question of punctuation<span class="comma">,</span> periods<span class="comma">,</span> commas<span class="comma">,</span> colons<span class="comma">,</span> semi-colons and capitals and small letters<span class="comma">.</span>
			<br><br>
			I have had a long and complicated life with all these<span class="comma">.</span>
			<br><br>
			Let us begin with these I use the least first and these are colons and semi-colons<span class="comma">,</span> one might add to these commas<span class="comma">.</span>
			<br><br>
			When I first began writing<span class="comma">,</span> I felt that writing should go on<span class="comma">,</span> I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on and if writing should go on what had colons and commas to do with it<span class="comma">,</span> what had periods to do with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing<span class="comma">.</span> What had colons and semi-colons to do with it what had commas to do with it what had periods to do with it<span class="comma">.</span>
			<br><br>
			What had periods to do with it<span class="comma">.</span> Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on<span class="comma">,</span> physically one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop some time then periods had to exist<span class="comma">.</span> Beside I had always like the look of periods and I liked what they did<span class="comma">.</span> Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on<span class="comma">,</span> it was nothing that interfered<span class="comma">,</span> it was only something that happened<span class="comma">,</span> and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening<span class="comma">,</span> I did not believe in periods and I used them<span class="comma">.</span> I really never stopped using them<span class="comma">.</span>
			<br><br>
			Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own to commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways<span class="comma">,</span> that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way<span class="comma">,</span> later I will read you a little of itv By the time I had written this poem about three years ago periods had come to have for me completely a life of their own<span class="comma">.</span> They could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt one’s writing with them that is not really interrupt one’s writing with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing and so they could be used and you could use them Periods could come to exist in this way and they could come in this way to have a life of their own<span class="comma">.</span> They did not serve you in any servile way as commas and colons and semi-colons do<span class="comma">.</span> Yes you do feel what I mean<span class="comma">.</span>
