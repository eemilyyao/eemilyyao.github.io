			<span class="disappear">Periods have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling of their own a time of their own</span><span class="period">.</span> <span class="disappear">And that feeling that life that necessity that time can express itself in an infinite variety that is the reason that I have always remained true to periods so much so that as I say recently I have felt that one could need them more than one had ever needed them</span><span class="period">.</span>
			<br><br>
			<span class="disappear">You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a comma<span class="comma">,</span> a colon or a semi-colon</span><span class="period">.</span>
			<br><br>
			<span class="disappear">There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons you can think of them as commas and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as periods and then using them can make you feel adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself never have</span><span class="comma">,</span> <span class="disappear">I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma and commas are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes</span><span class="period">.</span> <span class="disappear">Semi-colons and colons had for me from the first completely this character the character that a comma has and not the character that a period has and therefore and definitely I have never used them</span><span class="period">.</span> <span class="disappear">But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them something of the character of the period and so it might have been an adventure to use them</span><span class="period">.</span> <span class="disappear">I really do not think so</span><span class="period">.</span> <span class="disappear">I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely more comma than period and so really I cannot regret not having used them</span><span class="period">.</span> <span class="disappear">They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a comma but they are a comma all the same</span><span class="period">.</span> <span class="disappear">They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally within them the comma nature</span><span class="period">.</span> <span class="disappear">And now what does a comma do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them</span><span class="period">.</span>
			<br><br>
			<span class="disappear">What does a comma do</span><span class="period">.</span>
			<br><br>
			<span class="disappear">I have refused them so often and left the out so much and did without them so continually that I have come finally to be indifferent to them</span><span class="period">.</span> <span class="disappear">I do not now care whether you put them in or not but for a long time I felt very definitely about them and would have nothing to do with them</span><span class="period">.</span>
			<br><br>
			<span class="disappear">As I say commas are servile and they have no life of their own</span><span class="comma">,</span> <span class="disappear">and their use is not a use</span><span class="comma">,</span> <span class="disappear">it is a way of replacing one’s own interest and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am doing</span><span class="period">.</span> <span class="disappear">A comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them</span><span class="comma">,</span> <span class="disappear">the use of them was positively degrading</span><span class="period">.</span> <span class="disappear">Let me tell you what I feel and what I mean and what I felt and what I meant</span><span class="period">.</span>
