			When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans<span class="disappear">,</span> verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me<span class="disappear">.</span> I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing<span class="disappear">.</span> 
			<br><br>
			Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always liked dependent adverbial clauses<span class="disappear">.</span> I have like dependent adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence and independence<span class="disappear">.</span> You can see how loving the intensity of complication of these things that commas would be degrading<span class="disappear">.</span> Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive complication would you want any artificial aid to bring about that simplicity<span class="disappear">.</span> Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity<span class="disappear">.</span> Do you see now why I feel about the comma as I did and as I do<span class="disappear">.</span>
			<br><br>
			Think about anything you really like to do and you will see what I mean<span class="disappear">.</span>
			<br><br>
			When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot<span class="disappear">,</span> at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread<span class="disappear">,</span> so anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written<span class="disappear">.</span> And what does a comma do<span class="disappear">,</span> a comma does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the comma<span class="disappear">.</span> A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you<span class="disappear">,</span> make you know yourself knowing it and the comma<span class="disappear">,</span> well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath<span class="disappear">.</span> It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on<span class="disappear">,</span> but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath<span class="disappear">.</span> Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt that about it very very strongly<span class="disappear">.</span> And so I almost never used a comma<span class="disappear">.</span> The longer<span class="disappear">,</span> the more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another<span class="disappear">,</span> the more the very more I had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves by themselves and not helping them<span class="disappear">,</span> and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma<span class="disappear">.</span>
			<br><br>
			So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose<span class="disappear">,</span> in poetry it is a little different but more so and later I will go into that<span class="disappear">.</span> But that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose<span class="disappear">.</span>
